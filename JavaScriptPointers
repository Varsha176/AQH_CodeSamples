1. Difference between var and let keywords?

ans: We can not re-declare a variable with the let keyword but re-declaration is possible with the let keyword.Reassign is allowed for both let and var
example of re-declaration: var a =10
         var a =20  (valid)

let a=10
let a =20 (error, can not redeclare block level variable)

var a =10
console.log(a)
let  a =10
console.log(a) (Identifier 'a' has already been declared)

Example of reassigning
let a =10
console.log(a)
  a =12
console.log(a) (valid)

2. How do you identify the data type of a variable?
use typeof()
console.log(typeof(a))

3. How many types of data are available in Javascript?
