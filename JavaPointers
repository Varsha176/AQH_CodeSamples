1. System.out.println---> System is the class, Out is the static field of the system class and println() is the method.
2. The main() method can be overloaded but can not be overridden because the static method can not be overridden in Java.
3. Local variables are stored in the stack while instance variables are stored in the heap.
4. Objects, arrays, strings, and non-primitive types are stored in the heap but their address are stored in the stack.

*************** Array Pointers ****************************
Arrays Class
-------------
package: import java. util.Arrays;

1. To sort use Arrays.sort(arr) --this method internally uses the quicksort algorithm. To sort characters it uses unicode values.
2. To sort some parts of an array use Arrays.sort(arr,from index,to index)
3. To compare arrays use Arrays.equals(arr1,arr2)
4. To print Arrays without using for loop we can use Arrays.toString(arr).
5. To print multidimensional arrays Use Arrays.deepToString(arr).
